## House Hunting & Making an Offer

### Key Considerations

**Property Must:**
- Be in USDA-eligible area (verify before making offer)
- Be structurally sound and meet safety standards
- Have adequate utilities (water, sewer/septic, electricity)
- Not be income-producing property

**Pricing Guidelines:**
- Follow the 3:1 rule: House price ≤ 3× annual income
- Example: $100,000 income → $300,000 house is appropriate
- Monthly housing costs should be ≤28% of gross monthly income
- Example: $100,000/year = $8,333/month × 0.28 = $2,333/month housing budget

### Making Your Offer

**Include in Your Offer:**
- Pre-approval letter from USDA-approved lender
- Earnest money commitment (typically 1% of purchase price, but not required)
- Contingencies: inspection, appraisal, financing
- Request seller concessions if needed (up to 6% of purchase price allowed)

**Negotiation Points:**
- Closing cost assistance (seller can contribute to closing costs)
- Repairs discovered during inspection
- Price adjustments if appraisal comes in low

**Example from actual experience:**
- House listed: Multiple months on market, previously lost a buyer
- Offer: $299,000 (later adjusted to $301,000)
- Seller contribution: $7,000 toward closing costs
- Contract signed: Evening signing, moved quickly

```

**Actual experience showed:**
- Organization speeds up process significantly
- Having everything ready prevents delays
- Multiple explanation letters were required
- Proactive disclosure is better than reactive explanations
- Clear documentation makes underwriting faster

### Specific Signed Statement Templates Required

During your USDA loan process, you may need to create formal signed statements beyond simple explanation letters. These are typically requested by underwriters and must be printed, signed, and submitted.

**1. Household Declaration Statement**

**Purpose:** Document all household members and confirm income sources

**Required Information:**
- Full names and ages of ALL household members
- Statement identifying sole income earner(s)
- Confirmation of household member employment status
- Your handwritten or digital signature
- Date signed

**Example template:**
```
HOUSEHOLD DECLARATION

Individuals Living in the Home:
- [Name], Age: [Age]
- [Name], Age: [Age]
- [Name], Age: [Age]
- [Name], Age: [Age]
- [Name], Age: [Age]

[Statement about income sources - example: "I am the only source 
of income. [Spouse name], my [husband/wife], is a homemaker and 
takes care of the children." OR "Both [name] and I contribute 
to household income through employment."]

Signed: _________________ Date: _________
```

**Why It's Required:**
- USDA needs to verify household size for income calculations
- Confirms all adult household members accounted for
- Verifies who contributes to household income
- Part of USDA's income eligibility verification

**2. Loan Payoff Confirmation Statement**

If you paid off any debts during the mortgage process:

**Must Include:**
- Creditor name and account number
- Original loan amount
- Date paid in full
- Payment method (check, wire, etc.)
- Statement that account is closed/paid
- Your signature and date
- Supporting documentation (payment receipt, final statement)

**3. Source of Funds Declaration**

For any large deposits or asset transfers:

**Required Elements:**
- Specific amount and date of deposit/transfer
- Exact source of funds (employment bonus, tax refund, sale of item, etc.)
- Statement that funds are not borrowed
- Certification that information is accurate
- Supporting documentation attached
- Signature and date

**4. Property Occupancy Statement**

**Confirms:**
- Property will be your primary residence
- You intend to occupy within 60 days of closing
- You do not own other adequate housing
- You will not rent/lease the property
- Signature and date

This is critical for USDA loans as they're for primary residence only.

**Creating These Statements**

**Format Requirements:**
- Professional business letter format
- Clear heading/title
- Dated
- All required information included
- Legible signature (handwritten or digital)
- Professional appearance suitable for submission

**Digital Signature Options:**
If using digital signatures:
- Drawing tablet signatures are acceptable
- Must look like actual signature (not typed name)
- PDF should show clear signature image
- Some lenders require wet signatures on certain documents

**Pro Tips for Statement Creation:**
- Create clean, professional-looking documents
- Use standard fonts (Times New Roman, Arial)
- Include all required elements first time
- Keep copies of everything you sign
- Date accurately - don't backdate
- Be factual and concise
- Attach any supporting documentation referenced

**What Not to Do:**
- Don't use informal language
- Don't leave out required elements
- Don't sign blank statements
- Don't date incorrectly
- Don't contradict other documentation
- Don't provide false information

**Note:**
The household declaration statement is typically required by the underwriter to document all household members and confirm income sources. This helps establish household size for USDA income limit calculations and verifies who contributes to household income.

**5. Auto Billpayer/ACH Authorization Agreement**

If setting up automatic payments from your bank account:

**Required Elements:**
- Lender name and loan number
- Bank routing number (9 digits)
- Bank account number
- Account type (checking or savings)
- Account holder name and contact information
- Authorization statement for automatic withdrawals
- Monthly payment amount
- Payment date
- Right to cancel authorization
- Digital or handwritten signature
- Date signed

**Example template:**
```
[LENDER NAME]
Auto Billpayer Agreement Form

Loan Number: [Your loan number]

Bank Account Information:
Routing Number: [9-digit routing number]
Account Number: [Your account number]
Bank Name: [Your bank name]
Account Type: [Checking/Savings]

Account Holder: [Your full name]
Contact Phone: [Your phone number]

Authorization: I authorize [Lender Name] to initiate automatic 
monthly withdrawals from my designated account for my mortgage 
payment. I may cancel this authorization at any time by providing 
written notice at least 3 business days prior to the scheduled 
payment date.

Signed: _________________ Date: _________
```

**Why It's Required:**
- Establishes automatic payment from your account
- Protects both you and lender with clear authorization
- Documents account information for payments
- Required by federal banking regulations for ACH transfers

**6. Debt Satisfaction/Paid-in-Full Statement**

If you paid off any debts during the mortgage process that show on your credit report:

**Must Include:**
- Creditor name and complete account number
- Original loan/debt amount

- Current balance: $0.00
- Statement that debt is satisfied with no remaining obligation
- Explanation of circumstances (if derogatory)

Creditor: [Creditor Name]
Account Number: [Account number]
Original Amount: $[Original loan amount]
Final Payment: $[Final payment amount]
Payment Date: [Date paid in full]
Current Balance: $0.00

STATUS: PAID IN FULL

Explanation: [Explain circumstances - why account became delinquent, 
what prevented timely payment, how you discovered the issue, and how 
you resolved it. Be factual and concise.]

The account is now satisfied in full as agreed, and all payment 
arrangements were completed with the creditor.

I certify that this information is true and accurate.

Signed: _________________ Date: _________

Attachments: Payment confirmation, final account statement
```

**Why It's Required:**
- Proves debt is paid when credit report hasn't updated yet
- Required for underwriter to exclude from debt-to-income calculations
- Documents resolution of derogatory accounts
- Helps with credit report disputes
- Shows responsible resolution of past issues

**When This Is Needed:**
- Credit report shows balance but you paid it off recently
- Account in collections that you settled
- Paying off debt as condition of loan approval
- Derogatory account that needs explanation with proof of resolution

## Inspection & Appraisal

### Home Inspection

**Timeline:** Within 7-10 days of offer acceptance
**Cost:** $300-600 (paid directly to inspector)

**Process:**
1. Hire licensed home inspector (your choice, not dictated by lender)
2. Inspector examines: structure, roof, electrical, plumbing, HVAC, foundation
3. Receive detailed report (usually within 24-48 hours)
4. Review report with your agent

**After Inspection:**

You have several options based on results:

1. **Request Repairs**
   - Focus on safety issues and functional problems
   - Examples: garage door safety features, water heater issues, drainage problems
   - Seller can accept, counter, or refuse

2. **Request Price Reduction or Credit**
   - Instead of repairs, ask for money off purchase price
   - Or request closing cost credit to handle repairs yourself

3. **Accept As-Is**
   - If satisfied with property condition
   - Common if price already reflects needed work

4. **Walk Away**
   - If inspection reveals deal-breakers
   - Must be within inspection contingency period

**Example from actual experience:**
- Issues found: water heater installed backwards, garage door safety feature inoperable, drainage concerns
- Negotiation: Focused on safety and water issues
- Outcome: Seller agreed to address priority items

### Home Appraisal

**Timeline:** 7-14 days after ordering
**Cost:** $400-700 (paid by you, usually upfront)

**Purpose:**
- Lender verifies home value matches or exceeds loan amount
- Required by all mortgage lenders to protect their investment
- Independent third-party assessment

**Appraisal Process:**
1. Lender orders from licensed appraiser
2. Appraiser visits property
3. Reviews recent comparable sales (last 6 months)
4. Assesses property condition, square footage, features
5. Provides report with estimated market value

**If Appraisal Comes in at or Above Purchase Price:**
- Everything proceeds smoothly
- Loan approved at agreed terms

**If Appraisal Comes in Below Purchase Price:**

Example: You're buying for $299,000, appraises at $290,000

Options:
1. **Negotiate Price Reduction** (most common with motivated sellers)
   - Seller reduces to appraisal value
   - Loan proceeds as planned

2. **Bring Cash to Cover Gap**
   - You provide $9,000 additional cash
   - Not ideal but keeps deal together

3. **Split the Difference**
   - Seller reduces to $294,500, you bring $4,500
   - Common compromise

4. **Walk Away**
   - If contract has appraisal contingency
   - Earnest money returned

**Example from actual experience:**
- Purchase price: $301,000
- Appraisal: Came in at purchase price (common outcome)
- Process: Smooth, no renegotiation needed

**Interesting Note:** Houses often appraise at exactly the contract price due to anchoring bias - appraisers know the purchase price and it influences their assessment. This is normal and accepted in the industry.

## Underwriting & USDA Approval

### Timeline: Weeks 2-4

### Lender Underwriting (2-3 weeks)

**Timeline: Week 3-4**

**Process:**

2. USDA reviews using Guaranteed Underwriting System (GUS)
3. GUS provides automated underwriting decision for qualifying applications
4. USDA issues Conditional Commitment
5. Any USDA-specific conditions must be satisfied
6. Final USDA approval granted

**Example from actual experience:**
- Submitted to USDA: Thursday afternoon
- Approved: Following Tuesday
- Timeline: 2-3 business days (faster than typical)
- Result: Very smooth process with experienced lender

**Typical Timeline:**
- Standard processing: 30-60 days total

---

## Post-Closing

### Immediate Actions (First Week)

- Previous owners and contractors may have keys
- Cost: $100-300 for professional rekey

### First Month

**1. Your First Payment**
- Due on the 1st of the month following closing
- Example: Close September 26 → First payment due November 1

- Set up autopay or payment reminders

**2. Monthly Payment Breakdown**
Example from actual experience ($302,020 loan at 6.275%):
- Principal & Interest: ~$1,860
- USDA Annual Fee (0.35%): ~$88/month
- Property Taxes (escrowed): ~$273/month
- Homeowners Insurance (escrowed): ~$100-150/month
- **Total Monthly Payment: $2,520.53**

**3. Extra Principal Payments Strategy**
- Pay extra toward principal to save interest and pay off early
- Even $100/month extra saves tens of thousands in interest
- Example strategy: Budget $3,000/month, apply $480 extra to principal
- Result: Pay off 30-year mortgage in ~19 years, save $190,000+ in interest

### First Year

**1. Homestead Exemption**
- Apply immediately (reduces property taxes)
- Typically reduces taxable value by $25,000

- Deadline is typically first business day after December 31st

**2. Escrow Analysis**
- Mortgage servicer reviews escrow account annually
- Verifies proper amount collected for taxes and insurance
- May adjust monthly payment up or down
- First analysis typically 12 months after closing
- Possible refund if over-collected

**3. Property Tax Timing**
- First full tax bill after closing may be surprising
- Taxes paid in arrears in most states
- Escrow builds up to cover future payments
- Homestead exemption kicks in for following year

**4. Document Retention**
- Keep all closing documents permanently
- Keep annual mortgage statements for taxes

**3. Know Your Monthly Payment**
- Principal & Interest
- USDA annual fee (0.35%)
- Property taxes (escrowed)
- Homeowners insurance (escrowed)
- Flood insurance if applicable (escrowed)

### After Closing

**1. Apply for Homestead Exemption Immediately**
- Can save $400+/year on property taxes
- Usually at county auditor office
- Deadline varies by state
- Don't delay - easy money savings

**2. Start Extra Principal Payments Early**
- Even small extra amounts save huge interest
- First payment sets the tone
- Consider making first payment extra large
- Example: Required $2,520 + $1,480 extra = massive interest savings

**3. Build Emergency Fund**
- Home repairs happen unexpectedly
- HVAC, roof, appliances fail
- Target 3-6 months expenses
- Balance between mortgage payoff and emergency savings

**4. Consider Refinancing When Rates Drop**
- Monitor rates continuously
- 1% drop = $170-200/month savings
- Eliminates mortgage insurance if refinancing conventional
- No-cost refinance options available

### USDA-Specific Tips

**1. Understand Your Loan Type**
- USDA Guaranteed (Section 502) - most common
- Offered through private lenders with USDA backing
- Different from USDA Direct loans (income-restricted)

**2. USDA Benefits Beyond Purchase**
- Payment assistance if experiencing hardship
- Moratorium relief options
- Section 504 repair grants/loans if 62+ years old
- Energy efficiency improvement programs
- Refinancing through USDA Streamlined Assist program

**3. Annual Fee is Permanent**
- 0.35% annual fee for life of loan
- Much cheaper than PMI (typically 0.5-1%)
- Cannot be removed by reaching 20% equity
- Only eliminated by refinancing to conventional
- Consider refinancing after 2-5 years if rates drop

**4. Property Must Remain Primary Residence**
- Cannot convert to rental (violates USDA terms)
- Must notify USDA if selling
- Prepayment penalties do not apply - can pay off anytime

### Financial Strategy

**1. Aggressive Payoff Plan**
- Budget more than minimum payment
- Example: Budget $3,000-4,000/month for $2,520 payment
- Apply extra to principal, not advance payment
- Every $1 extra saves $1.79 in interest and MI over loan life

**2. First Month Advantage**
- No payment due in month after closing
- Use that month's "payment" to build emergency fund
- Or make massive first payment
- Example: Close in September, no payment until November 1

**3. Wealth Building Timeline**
- Pay off in 8-10 years instead of 30 years
- Save $190,000+ in interest
- Free up $4,000/month for investing
- Compound that into retirement wealth

**4. Tax Benefits**
- Mortgage interest deduction (~$4,180/year savings)
- Property tax deduction (~$720/year savings)

## Summary

The USDA Guaranteed Loan program provides an excellent opportunity for homebuyers to purchase property with zero down payment in eligible areas. The process typically takes 30-60 days from contract to closing, with the actual USDA approval often taking just 2-5 business days when using the automated underwriting system.

Key advantages:
- 0% down payment
- Competitive interest rates (5.5-6.5% range with good credit)
- Lower mortgage insurance (0.35% annual) than FHA or PMI
- Seller concessions allowed up to 6% of purchase price
- Flexible credit requirements
- Can finance closing costs and USDA upfront fee

With proper preparation, responsive communication, and strategic negotiation, it's possible to close with minimal or even zero cash out of pocket. The combination of seller concessions, lender credits, and financed fees can cover nearly all closing costs.

Post-closing success comes from aggressive principal payments, immediate application for homestead exemption, and building an emergency fund while working toward early payoff. With disciplined extra payments, a 30-year mortgage can be paid off in 8-10 years, saving hundreds of thousands in interest and building substantial wealth.
